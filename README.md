# Pre-requisites
- Arduino Board: An Arduino Uno is recommended for beginners due to its ease of use and wide support.
- Piezo Buzzer: This acts as the output device for playing the melody.
- Push Button: Used to start the melody. When pressed, the Arduino will play "Baby Shark."
- Breadboard: Facilitates easy connections between the Arduino, piezo buzzer, button, potentiometer, and resistor without soldering.
- Jumper Wires: To make connections between the Arduino board, breadboard, and all components.
- USB Cable: To connect the Arduino to your computer for programming and power.


# Setup and Build

## Software Setup
- **Download and Install Arduino IDE:** Install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your computer. It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Create a New Circuit Project:** Open the Arduino IDE and create a new project for your circuit.
- **Write and Verify the Code:** Copy the code provided in the repository or write your own code to implement the desired functionality. Verify the code for any syntax errors.
- **Select Board and Port:** Choose the appropriate Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) and the correct COM port from the Tools menu.
- **Upload the Code:** Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Hardware Setup
- **Assemble the Circuit:** Follow the schematic diagram provided in the repository to assemble the circuit on a breadboard. Connect the Arduino board, piezo buzzer, push button, and any other components as shown.
- **Make Necessary Connections:** Use jumper wires to make connections between the components on the breadboard and the Arduino board.
- **Check Connections:** Double-check all connections to ensure they are secure and correct.
- **Power On:** Power up your Arduino board using a USB cable connected to your computer or an external power source.

# Running

- **Starting the Sequence:** Press the push button connected to the circuit to start the melody sequence.
- **Enjoy the Melody:** Listen to the "Baby Shark" melody played by the piezo buzzer.
- **Repeat:** If desired, press the button again to restart the sequence and enjoy the melody once more.
